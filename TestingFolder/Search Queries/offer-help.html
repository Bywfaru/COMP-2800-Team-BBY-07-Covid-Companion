    <h1>Have excess items? Donate! </h1>
    <p>
        We all know that COVID-19 has changed our lives drastically. Starting from shutdown of businesses, universities, schools, restaurants, cinema halls, airports to transitioning everything to online. Events like marriages are post-poned 
        for indefinite time period. Many people have lost their jobs. They are struggling hard to survive during this crisis. They are stuck at one place due to travel restrictions and shortage of money. Everyone starting from students to elderly 
        citizens are affected. There are long queues outside of the grocery stores which makes buying groceries a difficult task specially for elderly and people with disabilities. Moreover, some stores run out of essential items most of the time 
        as people are stocking the items for later use. Studies and grades of students are affected drastically. Everyone is trying to remain safe and cope up with the current situation.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you have some items which are not useful to you but can be useful for others then come forward and donate. It could be great help for someone who is trying to cope up in this situation. It can be anything starting from food, money, 
        daily essentials to any basic service like plumbing, etc. You just need to follow 3 easy steps:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Determine the item you want to donate</li>
        <li>Post it on the feed with you contact details</li>
        <li>Talk to the one who needs it about delivering it</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        That's it. These steps can definetely make someone's survival a bit easier in this time of hardship. Don't worry about the items, if they are not claimed by anyone,  they go straight to the food banks and charity groups.
    </p>
