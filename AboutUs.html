    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>
        Covid Companion allows people to come together and help during this time of crisis when people are living away from their families due to safety and travel restrictions.
        Many people are not able to buy/receive some supplies due to various reasons such as shortage of supplies, money, etc. Our website gives an opportunity for people 
        <ul>
            <li>To voluntarily donate items and provide services to help others in an organized manner</li>
            <li>To receive any kind of help possible as soon as possible</li>
            <li>To find information regarding COVID-19 such as health guidelines, regulations and news updates</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        We help people in getting everday necessities for free just by posting a request of the itme they need. It is a good way of connecting people together through the act of 
        kindness and generosity in these times of hardship. We help people to donate stuff so that the items can be used wisely. We try to help elderly, students, people with disabilities,
        people who are financially struggling as they have lost their jobs due to the shutdown of every business, people who are in isolation/quarantine, people who have lost someone due to
        COVID-19. Providing any type of help to the people is our goal.
    </p>

    <p>
        We also take care of charity groups and hence, the items which will be unclaimed after a specific period of time will go directly to charity groups. In this way, we can hellp them as well 
        as the items will not be wasted.
