    <p>
         We know that it is a very difficult time for everyone. People are staying away from their families due to safety reasons and travel restrictions. People have lost their jobs and now are facing financial crisis.
         Students who working and studying , aiming for paying the rent by themselves and even send money to their homeback are now jobless and pressurized about this whole situation. Working from home or having online classes
         is not everyone's cup of tea. People are not able to purchase essential items due too financial crisis or shortage of supplies in grocery stores. There is a long line outside of every grocery store due to social 
         distancing which makes it difficult for old citizens and people with disabilities.
