    <h1>Have excess items? Donate! </h1>
    <p>
        We all know that COVID-19 has changed our lives drastically. Starting from shutdown of businesses, universities, schools, restaurants, cinema halls, airports to transitioning everything to online. Events like marriages are post-poned 
        for indefinite time period. Many people have lost their jobs. They are struggling hard to survive during this crisis. They are stuck at one place due to travel restrictions and shortage of money. Everyone starting from students to elderly 
        citizens are affected. There are long queues outside of the grocery stores which makes buying groceries a difficult task specially for elderly and people with disabilities. Moreover, some stores run out of essential items most of the time 
        as people are stocking the items for later use. Studies and grades of students are affected drastically. Everyone is trying to remain safe and cope up with the current situation.
